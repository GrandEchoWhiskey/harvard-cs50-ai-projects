### Background:
Question Answering (QA) is a field within natural language processing focused on designing systems that can answer questions. Among the more famous question answering systems is Watson, the IBM computer that competed (and won) on Jeopardy!. A question answering system of Watson’s accuracy requires enormous complexity and vast amounts of data, but in this problem, we’ll design a very simple question answering system based on inverse document frequency.

### Getting Started:
Clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/GrandEchoWhiskey/harvard-cs50-ai-questions
```
Inside of the questions directory install nltk.
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Now run the program.
```
python questions.py corpus
```
