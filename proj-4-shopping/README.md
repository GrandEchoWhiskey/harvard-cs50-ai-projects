### Background:
When users are shopping online, not all will end up purchasing something. Most visitors to an online shopping website, in fact, likely don’t end up going through with a purchase during that web browsing session. It might be useful, though, for a shopping website to be able to predict whether a user intends to make a purchase or not: perhaps displaying different content to the user, like showing the user a discount offer if the website believes the user isn’t planning to complete the purchase. How could a website determine a user’s purchasing intent? That’s where machine learning will come in.

### Getting Started:
Clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/GrandEchoWhiskey/harvard-cs50-ai-shopping
```
Now run the program.
```
python shopping.py shopping.csv
```
